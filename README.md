# Blob Vault

## A Secure Way of Sharing Almost Anything

Choose and upload almost any content you like, it will be automatically encrypted using the [Fernet algorithm](https://github.com/fernet/spec/).

## Description

The file will be stored on disk and the corresponding download URL will be shared via the provided email address, using the [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com) service.

Make sure to copy the decryption key. It won't be stored on our servers. Once it's gone, it's gone. Apply the key by appending `?key=$keyvalue` to the download URL.

**One last thing:** Each blob can be downloaded once and only once. After the content is decrypted, it will be purged from our database.
